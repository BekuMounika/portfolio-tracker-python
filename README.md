Stock Portfolio Tracker - Task 2 of Code Alpha Internship This Python-based Stock Portfolio Tracker was created as part of Task-2 during my Code Alpha internship. It allows users to manage a stock portfolio by adding, removing, updating, and tracking stock performance. The current stock price is simulated randomly for demonstration purposes.
